      FASE: Forced Alignment System for Espa&ntilde;ol
    </h2>
      <p>
       Working with Phoneticians in the Spanish department at North Carolina State University, I'm developing a Forced-Alignment system for Spanish data. 
       <br/><br/>
       Acoustic models are trained on interviews from the <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jcmichno/cerd.html">Corpus de Espa&ntilde;ol del Raleigh-Durham</a> using the HTK Toolkit for manipulating Hidden Markov Models.
       <br/><br/>
       Slides from the intial presentation of the model at NWAV44 Toronto can be found <a href="files/wilbanks_nwav_2015.pdf">here</a>.

      VOT and Perceptions of Sexuality/Masculinity
    </h3>
      <p>
        Exploratory perception experiments I've conducted (see <a href="files/wilbanks_nwav_2013.pdf">these slides</a> from NWAV 42) show that increased duration of VOT in onset voiceless consonants increase perceptions of Gayness and Femininity in Male speech. 
        <br/><br/>
        I'm currently investigating the role of "clear" speech markers (which aspirated initial stops could be consider a part of) in perceptions of gayness as well as the impact of "typical" versus "atypical" faces in the processing of such effects.

      <h3>
        Semantic Priming and Speaker Sexuality
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've also investigated the role of social information in lexical priming and access. In a lexical decision task with a Straight Male, Straight Female, and Gay Male speaker, reaction time priming in certain target-stimuli pairs were significantly altered by the speaker's sex/sexuality/identity. 
        <br/><br/>
        For instance, participants who heard the word "Brush" were more strongly primed for "Teeth" when the males spoke "Brush" and more strongly primed for "Hair" when the female spoke "Brush". See <a href="files/wilbanks_semantic_priming_poster.pdf">this poster</a> for more details.

      Coarticulation

    <h3>
      /s/ Coarticulation in Raleigh
    </h3>
      <p>
        Within-word retraction of /s/ in /sr/ clusters (grocery) has been observed to be lexicalized in some instances. As Mielke et al. (2010) hypothesize, individual differences in /r/ production (i.e. bunched vs. retroflex) may condition degree of /s/ retraction in /sr/ clusters due to coarticulatory forces. 
        <br/><br/>
        Since /r/ articulations are difficult to disambiguate via acoustics, Iâ€™m interested in analyzing post-lexical /s/ retraction in order to identify speakers of interest from the corpus for ultrasound analysis.

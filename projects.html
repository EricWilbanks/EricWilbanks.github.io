      FASE: Forced Alignment System for Espa&ntilde;ol
    </h2>
      <p>
       Working with Phoneticians in the Spanish department at North Carolina State University, I'm developing a Forced-Alignment system for Spanish data. The Beta version of the web-aligner is available <a href="http://phon.chass.ncsu.edu/cgi-bin/webalign_fase.cgi">here</a>.
       <br/><br/>
       Acoustic models are trained on interviews from the <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jcmichno/cerd.html">Corpus de Espa&ntilde;ol del Raleigh-Durham</a> using the HTK Toolkit for manipulating Hidden Markov Models. 
       <br/><br/>
       Slides from the intial presentation of the model at NWAV44 Toronto can be found <a href="files/wilbanks_nwav_2015.pdf">here</a>.

      VOT and Perceptions of Sexuality/Masculinity
    </h3>
      <p>
        Exploratory perception experiments I've conducted (see <a href="files/wilbanks_nwav_2013.pdf">these slides</a> from NWAV 42) show that increased duration of VOT in onset voiceless consonants increase perceptions of Gayness and Femininity in Male speech. 
        <br/><br/>
        I'm currently investigating the role of "clear" speech markers (which aspirated initial stops could be consider a part of) in perceptions of gayness as well as the impact of "typical" versus "atypical" faces in the processing of such effects.

      <h3>
        Semantic Priming and Speaker Sexuality
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've also investigated the role of social information in lexical priming and access. In a lexical decision task with a Straight Male, Straight Female, and Gay Male speaker, reaction time priming in certain target-stimuli pairs were significantly altered by the speaker's sex/sexuality/identity. 
        <br/><br/>
        For instance, participants who heard the word "Brush" were more strongly primed for "Teeth" when the males spoke "Brush" and more strongly primed for "Hair" when the female spoke "Brush". See <a href="files/wilbanks_semantic_priming_poster.pdf">this poster</a> for more details.

      Coarticulation and Sound Change
    </h2>
    <h3>
      /s/ Coarticulation in Raleigh
    </h3>
      <p>
        I'm interested, most generally, in sound change and the role of phonetic factors in the actuation and realization of such changes.<br/>
        Most recently I've been working with acoustic data on (str) retraction, in which /s/ retracts towards the alveopalatal fricative in /str/ clusters. As I discussed in a presentation at PLC 40, this change is ongoing in Raleigh, with young women leading the retraction in medial position (i.e. 'restructure').
        <br/><br/>
        In the future I'll be examining the perception/production link within individual speakers for this variable, as well as investigating their articulatory realizations in order to better understand the processes which govern this sound change.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a second year Linguistics Master's student at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/linguistics/">North Carolina State University</a> and I'm affiliated with the <a href="http://phon.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">NCSU Phonology Lab</a>. 
    <br/>
    
    My interests include phonetic variation and language change, speech perception and social meaning, and laboratory/computational tools for sociolinguistics. 
    <br/>
    Take a look at some of my current and previous work as well as workshops I've led.</p>
